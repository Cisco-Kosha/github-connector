# Kosha Github Connector

GitHub is a web-based platform that provides version control, collaboration tools, and centralized repositories where you can manage and share code and collaborate with your team members.  

The Kosha GitHub connector enables you to perform REST API operations from the GitHub API in your Kosha workflow or custom application. Using the Kosha GitHub connector, you can directly access the GitHub platform to:

* Create commits
* Create tags
* Create an issue in a repo
* Get public information about a GitHub user

## Useful Actions

You can use the Kosha GitHub connector to manage repos, perform git actions, migrate files into GitHub, and manage repo issues

Refer to the Kosha GitHub connector [API specification](openapi.json) for details.

## Authentication

Kosha uses OAuth 2.0 to connect to GitHub. When you provision the GitHub connector, Kosha provides bootstrap credentials. After you sign in, GitHub gives Kosha an access token and your connector is provisioned. Kosha automatically refreshes your access token before it expires to ensure thereâ€™s no disruption in use.
